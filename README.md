# Student Performance Classification Using Random Forest

## Project Overview
This is a learning project where I built machine learning models to predict student performance levels (Low, Medium, High) based on exam scores and demographic data. The goal is to classify student performance categories using Random Forest classifiers.

## Dataset
The dataset includes student exam scores and demographic information such as parental education level, test preparation course completion, and more.

## Features Used
- Math Score
- Reading Score
- Writing Score
- Parental Level of Education (encoded)
- Test Preparation Course (encoded)

## What I Did
- Data preprocessing: encoding categorical variables and creating performance categories.
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Trained Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers using Pythonâ€™s scikit-learn library.
- Evaluated model performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Achieved approximately 76% accuracy with Random Forest.
